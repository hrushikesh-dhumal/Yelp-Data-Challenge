# Synopsis
My  Analysis of [Yelp Data Set](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) to predict user sentiments based on their review. I have converted data in json format to pandas data frame and made some changes to the original json data structure to reduce duplicates and make data more accessible for query and analysis. I am joining three tables, Business, Review and User. Following are the steps followed in the project-

## [Data Cleaning](yelp_01dataCleaning.ipynb)
1.	Lowercase
2.	Remove numbers
3.	Remove stop words using nltk
4.	Porter Stemming
5.	Create sparse matrix representation using scikit.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis](yelp_02EDA.ipynb)
1.	Frequency vs Rank for a sample of yelp review dataset
2.	To find out the stop words we are using inverse term document frequency. 
3.	To create a baseline for evaluating the algorithm, we are plotted the distribution of star category ratings.
4.	To get a better intuition of the text data we plotted the most common and recurring words in each of the reviews.

## Analysis
1.	[Bag of Words Generation](yelp_03bagOfWords.ipynb) - [Bag of words](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) representation of the user reviews.
2.	[Word Embeddings](yelp_04word2vec)- [Word embeddings](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) representation of the user reviews.
3.	Create models to predict sentiments based on user review and rating
	
	1. [Support Vector Machine](yelp_06SVM.ipynb)
	
	2. [Long Short Term Memory Neural Network](yelp_06LSTM.ipynb)
